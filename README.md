## User Story

As a User, I want to see what the night sky will look like in my location and check to weather to see if it's worth going stargazing tonight.

## Minimum Viable Product

The app meets minimum viable product status when a user opens the app, a map of the night sky directly over their location is displayed, and an assessment of the expected quality of star viewing based on the weather at their location is presented.
