## Description

Constellation Weather obtains a user location using either automatic geolocation (which will require the user's permission) or a postal code provided by the user. Once located, the app presents the user with a sky map at his location and advises the user about the weather conditions that will affect the quality of that night's skywatching.

## Installation

Constellation Weather requires no installation. However, a user will be prompted to allow her browser to use her location if she has not done provided such permission in the past.

## Usage

Constellation Weather is simple to use. Upon opening the app, the user is presented with a splash screen followed by a modal dialog box asking how the app should determine the user's location. Once the "Go!" button on modal dialog box is clicked, the splash page closes, and a results page appears showing the sky and constellations visible at the user's location and providing weather information that the user can consider when determining whether or not tonight will be a good night for skywatching. If the user wants to return to input another location, he clicks on the "Again!" button to return to the modal dialog box.
